I am a pre-final year CS major at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I am an aspiring researcher and have broadly explored my research interests in machine learning.

These excursions into various fields have been aided by the excellent guidance by top scholars and researchers such as Dr. Abir Das (Computer Vision), Dr. Vikash Kumar (Robotics), Dr. Abhishek Sinha (Online Convex Optimisation), Dr. Swagatam Das (Optimal Transport in ML), Dr. Amitalok Budkuley (Bayesian Persuasion), Dr. Sarani Bhattacharya (Hardware Security) and Dr. Shubhanshu Shekhar (Statistics).

I am open to both theoretical and experimental works and believe that the most practical thing in this world is a good theory backed by empirical evidence.
